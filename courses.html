         <p> Unger is a beautiful and very secluded park in the southwest part of the St. Louis area. This shorter
            wooden course is great for less experienced players who want some fun but not too hard challenges in a
            wooded environment.

         <p>Bluebird Park is a large, beautiful park in west St. Louis County, located just off of Manchester Rd. The
            disc golf course here uses the elevation and environment to make for a 9-hole experience that provides a
            challenging and variety-filled round.

         <p id="centerP">Schroeder Park</p>


         <p>Schroeder Park has very recently been updated to be a full 18 hole course. The new 9 holes use the woods
            around the original 9, and keep the short feel of the original design. This 18 hole design has been an idea
            that's been around for a while, and I will be sure to update this review once I get to play this course
            again. Check UDisc for the new layout.

         <p>Logan University is home to a disc golf course that provides a good amount of variety, including some
            challenges you won't see at many other courses in the area. This course will definitely test your endurance,
            and a low score will leave you feeling accomplished.

         <p id="centerP">Jefferson Barracks Park</p>


         <p>Jefferson Barracks, affectionately known as JB by the local disc golf scene, is an 18 hole park course
            located about 15-20 minutes south of downtown St. Louis. Jefferson Barracks park is next to a large national
            cemetery and Army/National Guard of the same name. As a whole, the area has a lot of historical military
            significance. As for the disc golf course, it is easily one of if not the most popular course in St. Louis.
