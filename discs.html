                This disc is a beauty! Excellent for pin-point accuracy or distance,

            <p id="centerP">Star Mako3</p>

            <p>The Mako3 is probably the straightest flying midrange disc in the game and it's a perfect midrange option
                for all skill levels. Mako3 has a smooth straight flight path with minimal fade in the end,
                when thrown with low to moderate amount of power. When thrown with high power, the Mako3 will gradually
                turn,
                making it optimal disc for long turning anhyzer shots even on a narrow line.
            </p>
